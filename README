The chess software that is developed for fun.
Initial creator is Leonid Rozenblyum
(the last name could also be spelled as Rozenblium according to Ukrainian transliteration rules)

Main goals for version1 are:
- support Chess Engine Communication Protocol (http://home.hccnet.nl/h.g.muller/engine-intf.html)
This protocol is one of de-facto standards in communicating between a chess GUI and an engine.
The well-known GUI implementations are XBoard/Winboard.
Probably the fastest way to implement is to take into account the 'Minimal protocol'
document http://home.hccnet.nl/h.g.muller/interfacing.txt
- know about all chess rules (including ambiguities with the 3'd position repetition and insufficient material)
- be able to choose at least random 'correct according to rules' move.
